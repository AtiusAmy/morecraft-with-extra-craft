# morecraft-with-extra-craft
   I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and professional like Mo' Creatures) for Minecraft Fabric.  This has been brewing since augest, and is NOT starting to get ready.  I'd like any feedback on things people like/dislike in the mod.   I've currently ported my old tokay gecko mod, and things seem to work. This implies that I'll get something practical within a few months, and I'd like to know what features most people would want.  Any suggestions are welcome, but I won't promise I'll implement them :-)

Yes I stole that entire line from Linux :D

Very WIP!! made with mcreator because idk how code works :(
